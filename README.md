# Equity-Research

My idea here is to create a writeup of my investment process that I have gathered from readings, articles, videos and more.
This is supposed to both help me refine my investment process and hopefully help others create their own.

This notebook will keep changing constantly as I hope to improve the explanations and structure.

Cycle -> Stock -> Execution

The way this writeup will be structured is going from Macro Economics to Financial theory to Mathematics as I believe that investing and trading can't be separated into specific fields.

To understand what will happen in the future, the past is the best way to look for answers.

Even if it seems like this is the end, it most likely isn't.
